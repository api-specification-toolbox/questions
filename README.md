# Questions
This is a project born out of the API Specification Toolbox discussions each conducted each Friday. Aggregating some of the most common questions that get asked about OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, Postman Collections, and JSON Schema, and then providing quick video answers that help people get the answers they need.

If you have a question you'd like to see answered, or would like to answer questions yourself, please submit a GitHub issue for the question. This project is just getting started, and if you have any questions feel free to submit a GitHub issue or reach out to Kin Lane (@kinlane) and the community directly.
